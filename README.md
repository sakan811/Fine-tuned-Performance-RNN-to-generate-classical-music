# Fine-tuned-Performance-RNN-to-generate-classical-music

This is my research project for one of the modules I'm taking for my Master degree, but I want to continue it even the course is finished. 

My goal is to fine-tune the Performance RNN to generate legit classical music.

Right now, I'm feeding the model with 240 classical music scores in MusicXML file formats. All of them are public domain.

The training is in progress....
