# Fine-tuning-Performance-RNN-to-generate-classical-music

This is my research project for one of the modules I'm taking for my Master degree.
My goal is to fine-tune the Performance RNN, a model from Magenta project, to generate legit classical music. 
The model was fed with 240 classical music scores in MusicXML file formats. All of them are public domain.

I trained the model for 40k checkpoint. 
Here's the result:
